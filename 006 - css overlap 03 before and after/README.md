# 006 - CSS Overlap 03 - ::before and ::after

I finally figured out how to write markup for overlap CSS effects without extra markup: `::before` and `::after`. I understand that this is usually used for things like adding content like parentheses around a certain element like a blockquote or a making a counter for lists, but why not add a little visual flare to elements?

I also remembered that you can add `transition: all 1s` to the parent element and that will keep you from repeating `transition: 1s` on hover. That saves me a ton of frustration. 

side note: Took some time off to visit some friends from Denver that were in CDMX to tour them around the city.
