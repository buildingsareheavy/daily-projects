            <h3>Sarah McKenzie: Sanctum</h3>
            <p>sanctum</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                A sacred place, especially a shrine within a temple or church.
              </li>
              <li>A private place from which most people are excluded.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              In Sanctum, Sarah McKenzie’s third solo exhibition with David B.
              Smith Gallery, the artist presents the newest works in her ongoing
              White Walls series. Through her paintings of museum and gallery
              interiors, McKenzie examines the architecture of exhibition space
              and the role it plays in framing and orienting our experience of
              art. The rooms and corridors depicted in these works are at once
              austere and opulent; makeshift and highly controlled; impersonal
              and sacred. McKenzie celebrates these pristine rooms and the
              specific works of art they feature, but her paintings also raise
              issues of access and inclusion, both for artists and for viewers.
            </p>

            <p>
              While art galleries and museums may offer a sense of sanctuary to
              some, others may feel marginalized or shut out entirely.
              Historically, these rooms have been highly exclusive, promoting a
              narrow, dominant art narrative while omitting alternative
              perspectives. Although the art world has begun to reconsider that
              narrative, as demonstrated by the 2019 Hilma af Klint exhibition
              at the Guggenheim, captured in McKenzie’s painting, Inner Circle,
              the sense of exclusivity nonetheless persists. As all the works in
              Sanctum reveal, these spaces have the power to confer status and
              meaning on the art contained within and the individuals who gain
              entry.
            </p>

            <p>
              With an emphasis on geometry, pattern, and surface, McKenzie's
              paintings hover in a zone between stark realism and abstraction.
              Playing with the materiality of paint, she works with both oils
              and acrylics and juxtaposes various painting “styles” on each
              canvas, deliberately undermining the illusion of depth and the
              overall unity of the completed image. McKenzie’s work often
              appears photo-realistic when seen in reproduction, but, seen in
              person, the painted surface asserts itself forcefully, enabling
              the viewer to discover the process by which the image was
              constructed.
