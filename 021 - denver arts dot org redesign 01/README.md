# 021 - Denver Arts (dot) org - Redesign 01

I wanted to do a quick redesign of a [DenverArts.org](http://denverarts.org) post.

I am still working out what would work best in the future if/when we take over the site, but I wanted to see what was possible with the current data provided. I would ultimately like to add calendar functionality and a few other things, which would defintely change the layout, especially in the header section. Also the CSS is pretty messy because I kept moving things around, but I know I am stil going to go back and make lots of changes, probably from scratch.

Overall it was fun to see how quickly I could put whip something up in a few hours that could be a starter template for blog posts.
