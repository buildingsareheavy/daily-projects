# 010 - CSS Grid 05 with Inverted Drop Shadows

Im curious of how to make a visually interesting grid even when there is not much content to work with. Adding color backgrounds and inset dropshadows I think add a nice little touch.

I essentially took the code from *CSS Grid 02* and refactored it. I am feeling like I am in a good place with grid and flexbox now. I keep trying to add more and more, and maybe it's my lack of imagination or maybe it's my lack of javascript, but I don't find myself coming up with much new stuff. Today has been lackluster as far as color theory, which I know this is not what these exercises are all about. But if you look good, you feel good, and I want to make these look great; however simple they are.

[Roc√≠o](https://tinyinterface.com/) helped me with my [reference site](http://strelka.com/) but I was really disappointed to find out that most of the cool layout stuff was just images. Nothing was done on the actual page.
