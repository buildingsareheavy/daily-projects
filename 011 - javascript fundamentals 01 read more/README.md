# 011 - Javascript Fundamentals 01 - Read More on Click

I finished the book [Javascript for Web Designers](https://abookapart.com/products/javascript-for-web-designers) and I really like how it spoke about progressive enhancements. From my experience I have not seen that much in javascript tutorials, and although it might be implied, it isn't as apparent as in the CSS community. From my experience anyway.

I will admit that before I would've used jQuery to remove a class of `hide` or something, but I always knew that was the lazy way. This is admittedly more complex and still not as smooth, but it has error handling and everything!

Through this exercise I have learned about properties like `.setAttribute`, `.appendChild`, `.preventDefault`, and `addEventListener`.

Also, for the longest time I was confused about what an *IIFE* is. I still think for me it's kind of confusing on when exactly you use it, especially because I have been using React and Gatsby, and in a component type of environment, it's kind of hard to figure out how that fits in. That's why I'm learning I suppose ;P
