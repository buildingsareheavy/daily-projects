# 017 - CSS Grid Shapes

I wanted to mess with CSS grid and make cool patterns. I was trying to animate them with JS, but at the time I didn't have enough knowledge to animate them. I honestly forgot to commit this before. But now I have messed with JS more and could probably at least toggle some classes with vue, but if anything I should create a new daily-project for that, like a refactor of this one.

Also, it's been quite a while since I've done a daily project. I need to keep going with these ideas. I think I can get a lot more intricate now. Not so much "simple examples", like really thought out ideas!
