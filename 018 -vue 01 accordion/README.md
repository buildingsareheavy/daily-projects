# 018 - Vue 01 Accordion

This is a simplified version of a tutorial from [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/courses/getting-started-with-vue/vue-events-building-an-accordion). It used Bulma for CSS and got kind of confusing with different classes and extra divs and stuff.

So this is actually pretty straight forward. Like how to bind classes with an event. I basically have it set to toggle the classes of `is-open` and `is-closed`, very simple.
