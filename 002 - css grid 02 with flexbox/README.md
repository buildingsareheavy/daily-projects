# 002 - CSS Grid 02 with flexbox

Using *CSS Grid* for a card layout instead of a graphic layout is extremely easy! WOW! It was probably less than 10 lines of CSS. Everything else is styling.

I need to go back to refactor some of the CSS because I started out thinking I could make a boilerplate of *global CSS* but it actually proved harder to test for browsers that don't support grid or flexbox.

Also added an `each` loop in SCSS for font-weights.
```
//Example
.font-thin, .font-100 { 
    font-weight: 100; 
    }

.font-light, .font-300 {
    font-weight: 300;
}    
```
