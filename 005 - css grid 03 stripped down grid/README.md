# 005 - CSS Grid 03 stripped down grid

I have been making exercises I've found beautiful, but I have also filled things with a lot of extra styling. This time around I wanted to focus solely on the *grid*  CSS with some *flexbox*. 

Absolutely I could add more to this and make it look more interesting, but it's also nice to write a complex grid (with a mobile layout, and fallback) in about 60 lines of CSS.

Nothing spectacular, just a clean reference.
