# 003 - css overlap 01 padding and box-shadow

Just as much a study on color as on div overlapping, this was an exercise on the limitations of using padding for separating nested divs when `margin: 0 auto`. 

Essentially the child div will most easily move to the right and down. For the opposite effect, or possibly an easier effect is to add a `box-shadow`.

Nothing too crazy with CSS, just more of an observation exercise.
