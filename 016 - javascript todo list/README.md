# 016 - Javascript Todo List 01

The first book I ever got about Javascript was [Javascript & JQuery](http://javascriptbook.com/) by Jon Duckett, and it was the logical next step after my first book [HTML & CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/), but something about it didn't feel right. It kept telling me to do stuff but it would explain later, keep using it, we'll explain later, and then when it came time to explain it was just like "well, this is just best practice". Don't get me wrong the graphics were amazing, but I already knew basic logic stuff, I just didn't know Javascript. I still don't know too much about the DOM. But the exercises in the book were all basically just a todo list. First in vanilla JS and then in jQuery. Not the best reference tbh.

Anyways, here I am, and I found a really good [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wCpkOk2uCg). He kind of blasts thru some stuff, and talks really fast, but it's all there.

The big takeaway is that all of this stuff is stuff I already knew. Like `getElementById` and `addEventListener`. It was just walking thru the steps to put it all together. There is a [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGLZ2pwCaiI) to the series that I'm going to follow up on. This is just the basics. There is limited functionality and no caching or anything like that. I didn't want to refactor the js too much, because I want to see what's going to happen in the next video.

The takeway is that I realistically could have done this without a tutorial but it was important to do it once with one first.
