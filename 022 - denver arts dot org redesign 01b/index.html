              <strong>Stacey Steers</strong> is known internationally for her
              process-driven, labor-intensive animated films composed of
              thousands of handmade works on paper. Her more recent work also
              includes collaborative installations that join invented,
              three-dimensional production elements with film loops. Her films
              have screened at Sundance Film Festival, Telluride Film Festival,
              International Film Festival Rotterdam, Locarno International Film
              Festival, Museum of Modern Art in New York, Lincoln Center in New
              York, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC among
              dozens of other venues, and she has won numerous prizes. Steers is
              the recipient of major grants and fellowships from the Guggenheim
              Foundation, Creative Capital, and the American Film Institute. She
              is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
              She is currently represented by Robischon Gallery in Denver.

            <p>
              <strong>Margaretta Gilboy</strong> (1943-2017) was a much
              acclaimed and influential artist whose work — though often
              described as realist — defies easy classification. Working
              primarily in oil and watercolor, Gilboy created paintings brimming
              with a seemingly incongruous and occasionally off-kilter
              deployment of objects both Eastern and Western. Her expertly and
              tenderly painted still lifes and portraits owe much of their
              sophistication to an oblique dialogue between art-historical
              masterpieces and objects of quotidian domesticity. Gilboy
              knowingly incorporates a play between objects deeply suffused with
              emotive and psycho-spiritual energies and ordinary objects of
              decorative craft or mass-production.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although she was heavily influenced by Asian philosophy,
              spirituality, and art, her paintings of people are palpably
              physical and vibrantly earth-bound. Her paintings of puppets and
              dolls are also linked to portraiture—they grant humanity to
              inanimate objects, in turn allowing us to engage with the object
              as if it were generating a real world of expressive complexity.
              The commingling of Modernism, the Renaissance, the Baroque, and
              Asian influences, particularly Japanese woodblock prints, shaped
              her artistic point of view and provide the cohesive tension that
              informs and animates her remarkable work.
