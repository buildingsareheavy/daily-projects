# Daily Projects

Often daily exercises and experiments.

## Setup

Since all projects are in thier own directory and are basic enough to only use `sass` and `browser-sync` they can all share one `node_modules` folder, but have thier own `gulp.js`.

To get running, just `cd` into desired directory and type `gulp` to run everything. Pretty simple / lean setup. As projects get more complex I'm sure I'll add more dependencies and each directory will have it's own `package.json` and whatnot, but for now, it's nice and minimal.


## Resources

I will do my best to add a short description and a link to a codepen.io for each project in a *README.md* file.
