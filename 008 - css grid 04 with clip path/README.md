# 008 - CSS Grid with Clip Path

I really wanted to start messing with clip path so I found a good [geometric painting](https://www.saatchiart.com/art/Painting-memory-present/392843/198891/view) to reference. I drew out how I thought it should be laid out in a grid and it was extremely simple. I ended up changing up some of the row and column heights, and used a tool called [clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) that I learned from watching some of [Jen Simmons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag/) videos. 

Anyways, I had to make some minor adjustments, but nothing really too difficult. I used `grid-area` for brevity and since I had everything drawn out prior it was incredibly easy to plug in the numbers.
